# FiboGrid
Creating a grid of cells that increases its value and reacts based on fibonacci logic

Description:
Create a 50x50 grid of cells. When clicking a cell, all the cells in the same column and row are increased with value 1.
Empty cells will get value 1 when increased. After each change, cells will light up yellow for a bit. When there are 5 cells next to each other which are in the fibonacci sequence, these will be cleared and light up green shortly.
